## Overview

FileNavigator is a lightweight Python-based file system utility designed to simplify core file operations using an interactive console menu. The application focuses on three essential functions: creating files and folders, searching for files within directories, and locating keywords inside text files. By utilizing Python’s built-in `os` module for file handling and directory traversal, FileNavigator provides a clean, minimal, and practical solution for basic file system management tasks.

The program is structured with modular functions that clearly separate each operation, ensuring maintainability and readability. It serves as an effective demonstration of file processing, directory navigation, and search logic, making it suitable for academic learning and simple real-world usage.

## Key Features

### File and Folder Creation

This module enables users to create a new directory at a specified path, generate a file inside it, and write custom content into that file. It demonstrates the use of directory creation, file handling, and input-driven operations.

### File Search in Directory

Users can search for a specific file within a directory. The system recursively scans all subdirectories and returns the full path of the file if found, offering an efficient approach to directory traversal.

### Keyword Search Across Files

Given a keyword and a directory path, the program examines all files within that directory—recursively—identifying every file that contains the keyword. It also reports the exact line number and the matching line, ensuring precise search results.

## Conclusion

FileNavigator offers a streamlined environment for essential file system operations, packaged within a simple and intuitive Python interface. By focusing on key functionalities like creation, search, and keyword detection, the tool balances practicality with clarity. Its modular structure makes it easy to extend, adapt, or integrate into larger systems, while remaining a clean educational example of Python file handling and directory processing.
